### Exercise Tracker

## This is an exercise tracker which implements constructor, getter and setter methods (uncommon in Python, however useful in some instances). 
## The first part of the program has a constructor that requires two strings (for exercise's name and intensity) and an integer for the duration
## in minutes. These atributes are saved in the instance of the class, for user's convenience. Then, the getters should return all object's variables
## respectively and the setters will allow users to modify the values as needed. The last part of the program has a calorie burner calculator, which 
## will consider that a low intensity exercise burns 4 calories per minute, a medium one burns 8 calories per minute, and a high intensity one burns
## 12 calories per minute.

# ExerciseSession has three attributes: an exercise name, an intensity, and a duration.

class ExerciseSession:
    def __init__(self, exercise, intensity, duration):
        self.exercise=exercise
        self.intensity=intensity
        self.duration=duration
        
# Getter methods will automatically return exercise, intensity and duration

    def get_exercise(self):
        return self.exercise

    def get_intensity(self):
        return self.intensity

    def get_duration(self):
        return self.duration

# Setter methods will update object's variables as requested by user

    def set_exercise(self, new_exercise):
        self.exercise = new_exercise
        
    def set_intensity(self, new_intensity):
        self.intensity = new_intensity

    def set_duration(self, new_duration):
        self.duration = new_duration

# calories_burned doesn't need any parameters and will return the number of calories burned according to the following formula:
# User burns 4 calories per minute in low intensity.
# User burns 8 calories per minute in medium intensity.
# User burns 12 calories per minute in high intensity.

    def calories_burned(self):
        if self.intensity == "Low":
            return 4 * self.duration
        elif self.intensity == "Medium":
            return 8 * self.duration
        else:
            return 12 * self.duration

# Requests to this tracker are intended to be performed as variables, for example:
# new_exercise = ExerciseSession(exercise="Running", intensity="Low", duration=60) or
# new_exercise = ExerciseSession("Running", "Low", 60)
